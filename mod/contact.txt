Hey Xcone, I looked around a bit but couldn't find out how to contact you. I am planning on adding a feature to P.U.M.P. to pop up a ui like bob's inserters configure that will facilitate pointing in a cardinal direction, and then I want to put an arrow ui set in to choose the direction the pipes lead. I write here to ask if you would contact me on discord for some insightful information? Thanks! Really glad we got to do at least this. iamtimsson#2912
